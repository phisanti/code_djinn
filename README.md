# Installation

Installing Code Djinn from source via:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/phisanti/code_djinn.git

```

# Usage

To use Code Djinn, you need to initialize the configuration first. This is a one-time process that will save your preferences and settings. Here‚Äôs how you do it:

```
code_djinn --init
```

This will prompt you to enter some information, such as:

- Your OS family (e.g. Windows, MacOS, Linux). Code Djinn will try to detect it automatically, but you can also input it manually if it‚Äôs wrong.
- Your shell (e.g. bash, zsh, fish). Code Djinn will try to guess it from your environment variables, but you can also input it manually if it‚Äôs wrong.
- Your DeepInfra API key. This is required to access the AI engine that powers Code Djinn. Also, currently, the only model implemented is mistra7B, so, you have to activate that model.

# Bonus

What's djinn (‚Äúÿ¨ŸÜ‚Äù)?
In Arabic mythology, a Djinn (also spelled as Jinn or Genie) is a supernatural creature that is made from smokeless and scorching fire. They are often depicted as powerful and free-willed beings who can be either benevolent or malevolent. Djinns are believed to have the ability to shape-shift and can take on various forms, such as humans or animals. They are also known for their exceptional strength and their ability to travel great distances at extreme speeds. Despite their supernatural abilities, Djinns, like humans, are subject to judgment and will either be condemned to hell or rewarded with heaven in the afterlife.
